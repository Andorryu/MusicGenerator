# MusicGenerator

## Overview

There are two main goals of this program.

### Goal 1: Library

The first goal is to create a Python library that allows programmers to generate entire scores of sheet music programmatically. This is acheived by generating an xml file that represents the structure of a score. The XML file schema follows the same schema used by MuseScore, so music generated by using this program should be able to be opened in MuseScore.

### Goal 2: Generator

The second goal is to use the library to create a program that "randomly" generates sheet music. Using the power of Music Theory, the generated music should always *sound good*.
